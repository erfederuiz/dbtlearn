    description: The 'dim_hosts_cleansed' model is a transformation of the
      'raw_hosts' table from the 'AIRBNB.raw' schema. It contains information
      about Airbnb hosts, including their ID, name, whether they are a
      superhost, and timestamps for when their information was created and last
      updated. The 'host_id' column is a unique identifier for each host. The
      'host_name' column contains the names of the hosts, with any null values
      replaced by 'Anonymous'. The 'is_superhost' column indicates whether the
      host is a superhost. The 'created_at' and 'updated_at' columns are
      timestamps indicating when the host's information was first created and
      last updated, respectively.
    columns:
      - name: HOST_ID
        description: This is a unique identifier for each host in the Airbnb platform.
          It is a numeric value and is derived from the 'id' column in the
          'raw_hosts' table in the 'AIRBNB.raw' schema.
        data_type: NUMBER
      - name: HOST_NAME
        description: This column represents the name of the host. If the host's name is
          not provided, it is replaced with 'Anonymous'.
        data_type: VARCHAR
      - name: IS_SUPERHOST
        description: A VARCHAR field indicating whether the host is a superhost or not.
          The value is either 'true' or 'false'. Superhosts are experienced
          hosts who provide a shining example for other hosts, and extraordinary
          experiences for their guests.
        data_type: VARCHAR
      - name: CREATED_AT
        description: This column represents the timestamp when the host was created in
          the Airbnb system. The data type is TIMESTAMP_NTZ, which means it's a
          timestamp without a time zone.
        data_type: TIMESTAMP_NTZ
      - name: UPDATED_AT
        description: This column represents the timestamp when the host's information
          was last updated. The data type is TIMESTAMP_NTZ, which means it is a
          timestamp with no timezone. The value is automatically updated
          whenever the host's data changes.
        data_type: TIMESTAMP_NTZ
